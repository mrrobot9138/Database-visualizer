# Database-visualizer
API with a graphical representation of an SQL database using Flask to creating the API and Plotly for generating interactive graphical representations.
Certainly! Below is a simple template for a GitHub README for your Flask project with a Plotly visualization:

# Flask Plotly Data Visualization

This is a simple Flask web application that demonstrates data visualization using Plotly. The project includes a basic Flask app that fetches data from an SQLite database, converts it to a Pandas DataFrame, and creates an interactive Plotly scatter plot.

## Features

- Fetch data from an SQLite database using SQLAlchemy.
- Convert data to a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
- Create an interactive scatter plot using Plotly.
- Minimal example for educational purposes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your machine.

pip install Flask flask_sqlalchemy pandas plotly
Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/this repo
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application:

python app.py
Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser to see the interactive visualization.

Project Structure
app.py: Main Flask application file.
templates/index.html: HTML template for rendering the Plotly visualization.
Customization
